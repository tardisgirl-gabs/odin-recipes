1/16 Notes:
Git was being very frustrating today. When I attempted to commit, I started to get various errors such as "error: object file .git/objects/c6/248e9d7697e8f7ae8c0ad1a02a77e4fc8e3b95 is empty error: object file .git/objects/c6/248e9d7697e8f7ae8c0ad1a02a77e4fc8e3b95 is empty fatal: loose object c6248e9d7697e8f7ae8c0ad1a02a77e4fc8e3b95 (stored in .git/objects/c6/248e9d7697e8f7ae8c0ad1a02a77e4fc8e3b95) is corrupt". I had no idea what this meant and honestly no idea where .git was. 

I also had some trouble pushing the files afterward but I was able to fix that by merging.

I ended up fixing it,(so far at least lol.I wouldn't be suprised if it broke again) following bits and pieces of different tutorials and stack overflow answers and honestly kind of winging it at some points cause there was no specific article that fixed the whole problem.

Thank you to these article and tutorials for I would have given up without you:
